              We propose a novel framework for filtering image-text data by leveraging fine-tuned Multimodal Language Models (MLMs). Our approach outperforms predominant filtering methods (e.g. CLIPScore) via integrating the recent advances in MLMs. We design four distinct yet complementary metrics to holistically measure the quality of image-text data. A new pipeline is established to construct high-quality instruction data for fine-tuning MLMs as data filters. Comparing with CLIPScore, our MLM filters produce more precise and comprehensive scores that directly improve the quality of filtered data and boost the performance of pre-trained models. We achieve significant improvements over CLIPScore on popular foundation models (i.e. CLIP and BLIP2) and various downstream tasks. Our MLM filter can generalize to different models and tasks, and be used as a drop-in replacement for CLIPScore. An additional ablation study is provided to verify our design choices for the MLM filter.

              We propose to adopt fine-tuned Multimodal Language Model as effective data filters to select high-quality image-text data to promote the VLM pre-training, which involves three stages: 
              <ul type="1">
                <li>Construct multimodal instruction tuning data on proposed quality scoring tasks to fine-tune MLM to realize accurate quality assessment;</li>
                <li>Adopt the fine-tuned MLM Filter to generate quality scores for each data point in the data pool and then select the high-quality data;</li>
                <li>Pre-train VLMs using the filtered dataset and evaluate the pre-trained VLMs on downstream tasks to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed filtering method. </li>

          <b>Defining Metrics for Image-Text Quality Assessment. </b>We defined four different data quality metrics for comprehensive quality assessment of image-text paired data:
        <ul type="1">
        <li><b>Image-Text Matching (ITM)</b>: the ITM metric focuses on evaluating whether the image caption accurately represents the main features and objects of the image and captures its primary theme. The fine-tuned MLM data filter can explicitly generate the ITM score on a scale of 100. </li> 
        <li><b>Detail Fulfillment (ODF)</b>: the ODF metric focuses on evaluating whether the image caption provides detailed descriptions of objects that align with the image. Specifically, ODF assesses if the caption sufficiently describes the properties of the objects in the image, e.g. number, color, size, position, shape, etc. Compared with the ITM metric, the ODF metric focuses more on the fine-grained alignment between the detailed object properties in the image and the ones described in the corresponding caption. </li> 
        <li><b>Caption Text Quality (CTQ)</b>: the CTQ metric focuses on evaluating the text quality of image caption based on the grammatical correctness, diversity of vocabulary (e.g. the range and uniqueness of words), fluency (\eg smoothness and natural flow of sentences), readability, length, and structure. </li> 
        <li><b>Semantic Understanding (SU)</b>: the SU metric focuses on determining if the image caption provides additional semantic information that is not readily apparent just from the image itself. Such auxiliary semantic information can be (1) the professions of persons in the image; (2) the locations, addresses, festivals, country names, city names; (3) the names or entities of buildings, people, bird species, animal breeds, car models, engines in the image; (4) the social relationships between the people in the image, i.e. lovers, parent & child. We suggest that adopting SU metric for data filtering can select image-text pairs with auxiliary semantics, which can further enhance the commonsense reasoning capability of pre-trained VLMs. </li>
        </ul>

        <b>Other Data Construction Designs.</b> We use CC12M image-text data as the data resources and then sample 10k image-text pairs based on the clustered text embeddings of captions. We prompt the GPT-4/GPT-4V models using the following templates to construct initial 40k instruction data on 4 quality assessment tasks. Then we uniformly sample 4k instructions from initial 40k intructions based on the integer scores to avoid scoring bias brought by imbalanced fine-tuning. Additionally, we sample another 46k instruction data from LLaVA-665k multimodal instruction set to ensure the diversity of final 50k instruction dataset.
          <pre><code>
{image}
Text Caption: {caption}

Please evaluate if the provided text caption accurately represents the main features and objects of the image. 
The caption doesn't need to detail every aspect of the image, but it should capture its primary theme. 
Rate the overall quality of the text caption's match to the image on a scale of 1-100, considering the criteria mentioned.
A higher score indicates higher level of image text matching. 
Ensure that your scoring is nuanced and uses the entire range from 0 to 100, reflecting the subtle differences. 
The score should be given as an integer, with each number between 0 and 100 considered as a potential score, avoiding the tendency to round to multiples of 10.  
Please first output a single line containing the value indicating the scores. 
In the subsequent line, please provide a comprehensive explanation of your evaluation, avoiding any potential bias.

- 1 large carrot, gratedâ€‹
- Juice of half a lemonâ€‹
- A handful of chopped fresh parsley or mintâ€‹
- A few ice cubesâ€‹
- Optional: honey or maple syrup (adjust to taste)â€‹

Instructions:â€‹
1. In a large bowl, combine the sliced strawberries, blueberries, and carrot. Gently toss them together to mix.â€‹
2. Drizzle the juice of half a lemon over the fruit and vegetables to prevent them from oxidizing and add a refreshing citrus flavor.â€‹
3. Sprinkle the chopped fresh parsley or mint over the fruit and gently toss once more.â€‹
4. If desired, add a drizzle of honey or maple syrup for a touch of sweetness. Adjust the amount according to your taste preferences.â€‹
5. Cover the bowl and refrigerate the fruit salad for at least 30 minutes or up to a few hours. This allows the flavors to meld and creates a more refreshing salad.â€‹
6. Serve the fruit salad in cups or bowls, garnished with a sprinkle of fresh parsley or mint, if desired.â€‹

This fruit salad recipe is perfect for a healthy snack or side dish, and with the variety of ingredients available in your refrigerator, it should be easy to put together quickly.`]]

Second, be mindful of the structural integrity of the pier; avoid overloading it with too many people or excessive weight, as this could potentially damage the pier or cause it to collapse. Additionally, be aware of the surrounding wildlife and respect their space; do not harm or disturb them in any way. Finally, if you decide to go fishing, ensure that you adhere to any local fishing regulations and use appropriate fishing techniques to keep the lake ecosystem healthy and maintain the balance of the food chain.â€‹â€‹"],

As I stood on the pier, I couldn't help but feel a deep connection with nature, taking a moment to soak in the peaceful atmosphere.â€‹

One of the highlights of my trip was undoubtedly the fishing experience. The area is teeming with life, and I was thrilled to land a sizeable catch, despite the modest size of the lake. The joy of fishing in such a beautiful setting was truly rewarding, and it allowed me to take a break from my busy life and truly immerse myself in the tranquility of nature.â€‹

While exploring the surrounding area, I came across a family of birds that had built a nest close to the pier, adding to the charm of the location. Interacting with the wildlife and observing their behavior was an enriching experience that I'll cherish for years to come.â€‹

In conclusion, this idyllic destination provided me with an opportunity to unwind and recharge, surrounded by mesmerizing natural beauty and the gentle sounds of water and wildlife. If you're looking for a serene escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday life, this pier overlooking the lake is the perfect place to find solace and reconnect with nature.`
